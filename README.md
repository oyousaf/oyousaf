# Hey, I’m Omar 👋

I'm a **Front-End Developer** with a Bachelor's degree in *Web Design & Technology*, dedicated to crafting responsive, accessible, and visually engaging websites and web applications that deliver genuine value to users.

Since completing my degree, I’ve continued to develop my skills through both self-initiated projects and **freelance work for real clients**, producing production-ready websites tailored to specific business needs.

## 💡 Projects

Here are a few things I’ve built recently — they can all be viewed via my [portfolio website](https://oyousaf.dev)!

- 🚗 `ams`: A slick used car dealership SPA developed using Next.js, Appwrite, Framer Motion and Tailwind
- 🚲 `legxcy`: A full stack ecommerce app developed using the MERN Stack, Cloudinary and Stripe
- 👓 `pollards`: A full stack appointment management system developed using Next.js, Appwrite, Twilio, TypeScript and Tailwind

These projects reflect my ability to liaise with clients, interpret briefs, and deliver polished solutions that align with both functional and branding requirements.

I’m currently seeking my **first professional role in web development**, where I can contribute to a team environment, expand my technical expertise, and continue creating user-focused digital experiences.
